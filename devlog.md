11/10/1:33 AM- I know that this project is about a simulation of a bank with three tellers a manager and 50 customers. This project will use threads to simulate the tellers and customers so I will need the threads and semaphore classes.I plan to have a class that represents a Teller and a class that implements a customer. I will start with having the two interact with each other to make sure that the right information is being passed and it will start with just an introduction. After that I will advance until I get to what type of interaction the customer wants. I will then determine the interaction and edit both classes depending on what interaction is ocurring and will worry about the manager later. For now though the first step is just figuring out what semaphores I need and setting up all my list and my tracking variables.   

11/11/3:32 AM - Set up my variables and one of the semaphores I will need which is the door to allow two customers in. I am starting with only 2 customers and 1 teller for now just to make sure that the teller can respond to customers the door works and that the queue is set up correctly. I also set up the list of tellers and make sure that they are set up perfectly. Lastly created the classes I will need but did not apply the logic yet. Next session will fully set up the tellers with their ids and the customer class as well.

11/15/7:39 PM - Since last time I worked on the project I think I still need the customer class that will only have the customer id and the teller class will be identical as well.  I think in the interaction between the teller and customer I will need 4 semaphores in total one for teller asking for transaction the customer telling the transaction one for teller finishing transaction and the other one where customer leaves. I also plan to test starting the teller threads to indicate that the bank is open. Gonna test with a one teller and two customers for now. So the plan is to set up the tellers and customers and have the teller be intialized and to module just two customers coming into the bank.

11/16/ 6:40 PM - Ended up using a blocking queue instead of a linked list and queue lock to reduce the amount of semaphores I need to make it a bit more simple. I ended up finishing the customer and teller threads and showing having them interact with each other. Ended up figuring out the randomized implementation and for some reason was having trouble stopping the tellers properly so instead of a flag introduced a final queue insertion for tellers that signals it is time to stop. Got the concurrency working for two customers entering and being served by tellers. Am able to go through all 50 customers and shows the queue. Added 4 semaphores that represent teller being ready for transaction the customer choosing their transaction the teller finishing the transaction and customer leaving transaction. Got all the log messages complete with the right format. Had some trouble with the threads at first so introduced some wait times to allow for the tellers to be set up and customers to introduce them first and also for customers to leave only when transaction complete signal comes from the teller. Next thing is just working on the readme and cleaning up comments. Ended up with a total of 7 semaphores.

11/16/9:16 Finished the read me cleaned up comments and some naming conventions and everything should be good.
