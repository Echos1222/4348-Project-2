11/10/1:33 AM- I know that this project is about a simulation of a bank with three tellers a manager and 50 customers. This project will use threads to simulate the tellers and customers so I will need the threads and semaphore classes.I plan to have a class that represents a Teller and a class that implements a customer. I will start with having the two interact with each other to make sure that the right information is being passed and it will start with just an introduction. After that I will advance until I get to what type of interaction the customer wants. I will then determine the interaction and edit both classes depending on what interaction is ocurring and will worry about the manager later. For now though the first step is just figuring out what semaphores I need and setting up all my list and my tracking variables.   

11/11/3:32 AM - Set up my variables and one of the semaphores I will need which is the door to allow two customers in. I am starting with only 2 customers and 1 teller for now just to make sure that the teller can respond to customers the door works and that the queue is set up correctly. I also set up the list of tellers and make sure that they are set up perfectly. Lastly created the classes I will need but did not apply the logic yet. Next session will fully set up the tellers with their ids and the customer class as well.

11/15/7:39 PM - Since last time I worked on the project I think I still need the customer class that will only have the customer id and the teller class will be identical as well.  I think in the interaction between the teller and customer I will need 4 semaphores in total one for teller asking for transaction the customer telling the transaction one for teller finishing transaction and the other one where customer leaves. I also plan to test starting the teller threads to indicate that the bank is open. Gonna test with a one teller and two customers for now. So the plan is to set up the tellers and customers and have the teller be intialized and to module just two customers coming into the bank.
